Well, this is the second attempt to do an console editor. This is more funtional than the first one but is worst in performance.
Ill give up for now, in the future ill do a better text editor.
This one has a lot of bugs, and does not have a very good performance.
Also the code is very bad xd
Don't judge me for this xd
